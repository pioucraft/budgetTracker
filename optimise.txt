1. for the STOCKS, use a "cache" (cookies), so that when you open the app, you can see your money, but there's an indicator before all the stocks are fetched.
2. If stock/crypto doesn't exist, it crashes everything. So please don't, add try catch
3. fetch all the diferent CRYPTOS in one fetch function
